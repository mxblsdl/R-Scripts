# My First Leaflet Map

This was a simple mapping project I did as an introduction to [Leaflet for R](https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/).
I also utilized a web scrapping library in R, [rvest](https://github.com/hadley/rvest), to collect and organize the data from Wikipedia. 
The map shows all of the National Parks in the US with some custom markers. The markers display some basic stats about the parks.
